# Gated Phase Protocol

**Autonomous AI execution with quality gates. Works in your terminal with Claude Code, Cursor, or any AI coding assistant.**

## What Is This?

A **protocol** for autonomous executionâ€”not a framework you import, but file conventions you follow.

Like Git tracks code changes through `.git/`, `HEAD`, and commit messages, this protocol tracks autonomous work through:
- **`.repo/plan.yaml`** - Defines phases, briefs, and quality gates (single source of truth)
- **`.repo/state/current.json`** - Points to current phase
- **`.repo/critiques/<phase>.{md,OK}`** - Judge feedback

Any tool that follows these conventions can participate. This repo includes a reference implementation in Python, but you could rewrite it in Bash, Rust, or Make.

## Purpose

AI agents often drift off-task, skip tests, ignore scope boundaries, and require constant supervision. This protocol defines phases with quality gates. The judge blocks progression until all gates pass. The agent iterates until approved, then advances autonomously.

## Key Features

âœ… **Autonomous execution** - Agent works through phases without supervision
âœ… **Quality enforcement** - Tests, docs, lint, scope checking, optional LLM review
âœ… **Context-window proof** - All state in files, `./orient.sh` recovers context in <10 seconds
âœ… **Terminal-native** - No servers, no APIs, just files and shell commands
âœ… **Language-agnostic** - File-based protocol works for any language
âœ… **5-minute setup** - Clone, `pip install -r requirements.txt`, run demo
âœ… **Simple and focused** - ~1,200 lines of clean, maintainable code
âœ… **Scope justification** - Conversation over enforcement when scope drift occurs
âœ… **Learning reflection** - Capture insights and learnings after each phase
âœ… **Orient acknowledgment** - Mandatory context recovery between phases

## Usage

**Multi-phase projects** - Breaking work into 3+ sequential phases
**Quality-critical code** - Need tests + docs enforced automatically
**AI-assisted development** - Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, etc.
**Scope control** - Prevent drift and "drive-by" changes

**Not suitable for:**
- Single tasks (just prompt Claude directly)
- No quality requirements (gates add overhead)
- Exploratory coding (rigid phases slow down discovery)
- Non-git projects (drift prevention requires git)

## Setup

### Option 1: GitHub Setup (Recommended)

```bash
# Clone protocol tools repository
git clone https://github.com/PM-Frontier-Labs/judge-gated-orchestrator.git

# Install protocol tools in your project
cd your-project
../judge-gated-orchestrator/install-protocol.sh

# Create your project plan
touch .repo/plan.yaml

# Start your first phase
./tools/phasectl.py start P01-scaffold
```

**For detailed GitHub setup instructions, see [GITHUB_SETUP.md](GITHUB_SETUP.md)**

### Option 2: Use as Example Project

```bash
# Clone and use as example
git clone https://github.com/PM-Frontier-Labs/judge-gated-orchestrator.git
cd judge-gated-orchestrator

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Optional: Install LLM features for enhanced code review
pip install -r requirements-llm.txt

# See status
./orient.sh

# Start a phase
./tools/phasectl.py start P01-scaffold

# Try the review flow (after making changes)
./tools/phasectl.py review P01-scaffold
```

**Important:** The protocol tools are designed to be shared across projects. Each project should have its own `.repo/plan.yaml` file that defines project-specific phases and scope.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- `pathspec` (for scope resolution)
- `pyyaml` (for plan parsing)
- `anthropic` (optional, for LLM review)

Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Comparison

| Feature | This Protocol | Aider | LangGraph | Manual Prompting |
|---------|---------------|-------|-----------|------------------|
| **Quality gates** | Enforced | No | No | No |
| **Drift prevention** | Enforced | No | No | No |
| **Context-window proof** | File-based | Partial | No | No |
| **Autonomous multi-phase** | Built-in | No | Complex | No |
| **Language-agnostic** | Protocol | Yes | Python only | Yes |
| **Setup time** | 5 min | 2 min | 30 min | 0 min |
| **Overnight execution** | Supported | No | Possible | No |

## Implemented Gates

| Gate | What It Checks | Example |
|------|----------------|---------|
| **protocol_lock** | Protocol integrity | SHA256 verify `tools/judge.py` unchanged |
| **tests** | Test suite passes | `pytest` exit code must be 0 |
| **lint** | Static analysis | `ruff check .` exit code must be 0 |
| **docs** | Files updated | `README.md` must be modified |
| **drift** | Scope boundaries | Only `src/mvp/**` can change |
| **llm_review** | Semantic quality | Claude reviews architecture |

**Test scoping:**
- `test_scope: "scope"` - Only run tests matching phase scope
- `quarantine: [...]` - Skip specific tests with documented reasons

Gates are configurable per phase.

## Core Workflow Features

### Scope Justification
When out-of-scope changes are detected, you can justify them instead of reverting:

```bash
./tools/phasectl.py justify-scope P01-foundation
# System prompts for justification
# Saved to .repo/scope_audit/P01-foundation.md
# Gates pass with warning, human reviews later
```

### Learning Reflection
Capture insights and learnings after phase completion:

```bash
./tools/phasectl.py reflect P01-foundation
# Record what worked, what didn't
# Saved to .repo/learnings.md
# Displayed in orient.sh for future reference
```

### Orient Acknowledgment
Prevent context loss by requiring acknowledgment between phases:

```bash
./tools/phasectl.py next
# Error: Must acknowledge orient first
./orient.sh
./tools/phasectl.py acknowledge-orient
# Prompts for current understanding before advancing
```

## Core Workflow

```
1. Claude reads brief from plan.yaml (embedded in phase definition)
2. Claude implements files within scope
3. Claude runs: ./tools/phasectl.py review P01-scaffold
   â”œâ”€> Validates plan.yaml schema
   â”œâ”€> Shows diff summary (in-scope vs out-of-scope)
   â”œâ”€> Runs tests (with optional scope filtering)
   â”œâ”€> Invokes judge (with file locking)
   â””â”€> Judge checks all gates
4. Judge writes:
   â”œâ”€> .repo/critiques/P01-scaffold.md (if issues)
   â””â”€> .repo/critiques/P01-scaffold.OK (if approved)
5. If approved: ./tools/phasectl.py next â†’ advance
   If critique: fix issues â†’ re-run review
```

**The key:** Judge blocks until quality standards met. Agent iterates automatically.

## Real-World Usage

**Scenario:** 6-phase backend refactor

**Setup (you):**
- Write `.repo/plan.yaml` with 6 phases
- Embed briefs in each phase using `brief: |` syntax
- Define scope + gates for each phase

**Execution (Claude Code):**
- Reads P01 brief
- Implements changes
- Submits review, gets critique, fixes, re-submits, approved
- Advances to P02
- Repeats for all 6 phases

**Result:** Wake up to completed refactor, all tests passing, docs updated, no drift.

## Documentation Guide

### For Humans ðŸ‘¤

Start here if you're setting up or using the protocol:

1. **README.md** (this file) - Overview, philosophy, and why this exists
2. **GETTING_STARTED.md** - Practical guide from zero to running autonomous execution
   - Installation and demo
   - Setting up your project
   - Planning your roadmap
   - Executing phases with Claude
   - Troubleshooting and tips

### For Automation ðŸ¤–

**Execution mode** (autonomous phase implementation):
- **PROTOCOL.md** - Execution manual with file specs, commands, gates, and error handling
- Use this when: Human says "execute the current phase" or "read PROTOCOL.md and start working"

### Navigation

| Audience | Goal | Read This |
|----------|------|-----------|
| Human setting up | Understand what this is | README.md |
| Human using it | Learn how to use | GETTING_STARTED.md |
| AI executing phases | Implement within gates | PROTOCOL.md |

## Next Steps

**New here?** Read `GETTING_STARTED.md` for a step-by-step guide.

**Ready to use it?** Read `PROTOCOL.md` to execute phases.

**Integrating with CI/CD?** The protocol is just files + shell commands:
```bash
./tools/phasectl.py review $PHASE_ID
if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
  echo "Phase approved"
  ./tools/phasectl.py next
fi
```

## Philosophy

**This is a protocol, not a framework.**

You don't install it, you follow it. You don't import classes, you write files that match the conventions. You don't learn an API, you run shell commands.

Like Git tracks code changes, this protocol tracks autonomous work execution. The protocol defines file conventions for quality-gated phases.

## Get Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PM-Frontier-Labs/judge-gated-orchestrator.git
cd judge-gated-orchestrator
pip install -r requirements.txt
./orient.sh
```

Then read `PROTOCOL.md` to start working.
