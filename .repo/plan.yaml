        # Protocol Maintenance
        
        ## Objective
        Maintain and improve the judge-gated protocol tools.
        
        ## Scope
        - Protocol tools (tools/)
        - Documentation (*.md files)
        - Tests (tests/)
        - Configuration files
        
        ## Gates
        - Code quality checks
        - Documentation updates as needed
      
      scope:
        include:
          - "tools/**"
          - "*.md"
          - "tests/**"
          - "requirements.txt"
          - "install-protocol.sh"
        exclude:
          - "tools/__pycache__/**"
      
      gates:
        tests:
          must_pass: false  # No tests required for docs-only changes
        lint:
          must_pass: false  # Optional for this maintenance phase
        drift:
          allowed_out_of_scope_changes: 5  # Allow some flexibility
