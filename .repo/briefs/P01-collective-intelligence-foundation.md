# Phase P01: Collective Intelligence Foundation

## Objective
Implement file-based collective intelligence system for storing and retrieving execution patterns, enabling the protocol to learn from completed plans and improve future execution.

## Scope üéØ
‚úÖ YOU MAY CREATE/MODIFY:
- tools/lib/collective_intelligence.py - Core collective intelligence system
- tools/lib/execution_patterns.py - Pattern storage and retrieval
- tests/test_collective_intelligence.py - Tests for collective intelligence
- .repo/collective_intelligence/** - Directory structure for pattern storage
- PROTOCOL.md - Documentation for collective intelligence features

‚ùå DO NOT TOUCH:
- requirements.txt (separate phase)
- Other tools/ files not in scope
- Existing test files outside scope

## Required Artifacts
- [ ] tools/lib/collective_intelligence.py - Core system implementation
- [ ] tools/lib/execution_patterns.py - Pattern management
- [ ] tests/test_collective_intelligence.py - Comprehensive tests
- [ ] .repo/collective_intelligence/patterns.json - Initial pattern storage
- [ ] PROTOCOL.md - Updated documentation

## Gates
- Tests: Must pass (test_scope: "scope")
- Lint: Must pass
- Integrity: Must pass (file management discipline)
- Docs: PROTOCOL.md must be updated
- LLM Review: Enabled (complex system design)
- Drift: No out-of-scope changes allowed

## Implementation Steps
1. **Design Pattern Storage Schema**
   - Define JSON schema for execution patterns
   - Include phase outcomes, success factors, failure patterns
   - Design file-based storage structure
   - Plan for pattern versioning and evolution

2. **Implement Core System**
   - Create collective_intelligence.py with pattern storage/retrieval
   - Implement execution_patterns.py for pattern management
   - Add pattern serialization/deserialization
   - Implement pattern search and filtering

3. **Create Storage Infrastructure**
   - Set up .repo/collective_intelligence/ directory structure
   - Create initial patterns.json file
   - Implement pattern backup and recovery
   - Add pattern validation and integrity checks

4. **Comprehensive Testing**
   - Test pattern storage and retrieval
   - Test pattern search and filtering
   - Test error handling and edge cases
   - Test file system operations

5. **Documentation**
   - Update PROTOCOL.md with collective intelligence features
   - Document pattern schema and storage format
   - Add usage examples and best practices

## Success Criteria
- Pattern storage and retrieval works reliably
- File-based system is robust and fault-tolerant
- Pattern schema is extensible and well-designed
- System integrates cleanly with existing protocol
- Documentation is comprehensive and clear
